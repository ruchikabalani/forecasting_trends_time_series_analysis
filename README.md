# Time Series Analysis of Hungary Chickenpox dataset

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to generate numerical forecasts for chickenpox cases in 2015. To achieve this, we aim to create a predictive model that considers the trend and seasonal components of the historical data and can effectively forecast for the year 2015. Our focus is on identifying the most accurate model among the available options. To develop these forecasting models, we utilized the R language.
